            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Insect infestations are dangerous to canvas paintings for they can cause large losses of material and color alterations.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beetles (<em>Coleoptera</em>) do not usually consume the materials of canvas. However, they will eat organic material and impregnate the fabric with their feces. They cause erosions that can lead to a strong damage of structure.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Lepisma saccharina</em> is likely to be found in a painting collection. The silverfish consumes any material containing starch or polysaccharides. It commonly grazes on the surface of paintings, causing superficial damage. However, structural damage is not common.<sup><a href="Bibliography.html#Work6">[6]</a></sup></p>

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many sanitizing agents available, but the ones that are best for use with insect attacks of paintings are gases or liquids with a high vapor pressure. The first thing to consider is what substances can be used without damaging the painting more. The following list of sterilizing agents should never be employed:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>All acids and alkalis</li>
                <li>Halogen-containing compounds, such as carbon tetrachloride and dichloro-benzene</li>
                <li>All solvents for oil and varnish agents, such as thymol</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hydrogen cyanide is an effective gas, but a qualified specialist should only employ it, for it is a highly virulent poison. Carbon disulfide is a highly volatile liquid that has been found to be an effective and safe fumigant for painting materials. Carbon disulphide is highly flammable, and it must be kept away from any naked light and cigarette.  Carbon monoxide is ineffective against insect infestations.<sup><a href="Bibliography.html#Work8">[8]</a></sup></p>
            
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonchemical procedures for eliminating microbial and pest growth include low temperature, low oxygen environments, and thermal shocks.</p>
            
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the insects are killed and removed, the tunnels left by them may be filled with a natural resin so that the integrity of the structural support of the painting is not compromised.<sup><a href="Bibliography.html#Work6">[6]</a></sup></p>

            <div class="Header3" style="text-align:center"><h3>Bacterial</h3></div>
            
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be difficult to recognize bacterial growths for what they are. Alterations such as stains, powdery formations, efflorescence, cracking, and degradation of support polymers may be connected with non-biological causes. If a microbial growth is detected, it should be sampled with sterile spatulas or cotton swabs. The sample should be transferred to an agar plate for culture analysis. Four main genera of fungi have been isolated in art objects: <em>Alternaria</em>, <em>Aspergillus</em>, <em>Cladosporium</em>, and <em>Penicillium</em>.</p>
            
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Aspergillus</em> and <em>Penicillium</em> are considered the most widespread and destructive. They produce certain enzymes, including cellulases, proteases, β-glucosidase and many organic and inorganic acids. These enzymes are involved in the hydrolysis of cellulose and protein-based materials.<sup><a href="Bibliography.html#Work6">[6]</a></sup></p>

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rot fungi require an elevated moisture content to germinate. There are three types of fungi, categorized based on their method of attack on woody cell walls: soft-rot fungi, brown-rot fungi, and white-rot fungi.</p>
            
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soft-rot fungi secrete cellulase enzymes. The attack is characterized by a strong loss of the wood’s strength because the formation of wood cavities and cellulose degradation. Wood appears to be dark and spongy. Species of soft-rot fungi include Ascomycota and Deuromycota.</p>
            
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brown-rot fungi are members of the Basidiomycota. Decaying wood will look brown and will crack along lines of weakness. Most of the cellulose and hemicellulose are decayed. The brown-rot fungi will use cellulase and hemicellulase enzymes to decay. In addition, they may use oxidative processes involving the production of hydrogen peroxide.</p>
