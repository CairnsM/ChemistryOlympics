            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The success of any restoration or conservation procedure depends on the thoroughness of the initial examination. The first step in examination of a work of art is to view it under normal light. At this stage, the conservator may see any damages or additions that might need further examination with instruments.</p>
            
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next step is to view the painting under a raking light, or tangential light.<sup><a href="Bibliography.html#Work3">[3]</a></sup> In this technique, a painting is illuminated from one side. The raking light will reveal the surface texture of the painting. Raised paint surfaces facing the light will be illuminated while those facing away will create shadows.<sup><a href="Bibliography.html#Work4">[4]</a></sup> The light will exaggerate damages and irregularities such as panel splits, warping, dents, bulges, paint flaking, heavily re-touched areas, and accretions of dust and surface grime. Previous additions, corrections, and damage from vandalism may be detected at this stage.</p>
            
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next logical course of action is to expose an object to ultraviolet rays. These rays excite different materials in varying degrees of fluorescence. This light has little ability to penetrate beneath the layer of varnish. Recent additions, retouching, and recent layers of natural resin fluoresce distinctly when viewed under ultraviolet light. A trained eye is necessary to arrive at the correct interpretation of the data collected.</p>
            
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Infrared radiation penetrates deeper into the layers of paint, and the image viewed through infrared might not correspond to the image viewed with the naked eye. Thus, through the use of special techniques, the infrared image may be captured. In ideal conditions, the conservator may be able to view what a painting might look like after the painting was cleaner. Infrared rays may reveal where paint has been abraded or where the composition of the painting changed, whether by the original artist or not.</p>
            
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the paint of the structure has been examined, the inner structure should be examined using x-rays. These rays penetrate the structure of an object completely and will often reveal startling images. For example, a lead white ground will impede the transmission of x-rays. X-rays record all losses of paint and canvas, often helping to determine if the painting has been cut down in size. X-rays will also help determine if there is hidden damage or panels beneath the painting.</p>
