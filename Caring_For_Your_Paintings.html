            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traditional paintings come in layers: support, canvas, ground layer, the painting itself, and varnish.  The artist has several choices to make for each layer. For example, paint can be made of pigments in oil, acrylic (synthetics), encaustic (wax), tempera (egg), distemper (glue), casein (milk), gouache (plant gum), or any mixture of these. The paint can also be applied to many different supports. While canvas is most popular, artists may use other supports such as wood, paper, cardboard, pressed board, artist’s board, copper, ivory, glass, plaster or stone. Paintings will change over time, and the composition of specific layers of the painting must be considered before applying treatment.<sup><a href="Bibliography.html#Work1">[1]</a></sup></p>
            
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first step in preserving your painting is to document its condition through writing and photography. Take inventory of any and all cracks, tears, or discoloration. This way you can monitor any changes in your painting over time.<sup><a href="Bibliography.html#Work2">[2]</a></sup></p>
            
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A painting must be properly cared for in order to prevent the need for treatment. Paintings are best maintained in the following conditions:  relative humidity levels of 50% ± 5% and temperature of 65° ± 3° F.<sup><a href="Bibliography.html#Work3">[3]</a></sup> Different materials have different environmental guidelines, but the important thing to remember is that large and rapid environmental fluctuations will damage a painting very rapidly.<sup><a href="Bibliography.html#Work1">[1]</a></sup> If a temperature or humidity change must be made to a painting’s environment, it is best made gradually.<sup><a href="Bibliography.html#Work2">[2]</a></sup></p>
            
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One simple way to protect a painting is to attach a Fome-Cor, or archival cardboard backing, to the reverse of a painting. This will reduce the painting’s exposure to rapid environmental changes and keep out foreign objects and dust.<sup><a href="Bibliography.html#Work1">[1]</a></sup> </p>
            
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When displaying a painting, two main factors must be considered: location and lighting. You should select a safe place for your painting, away from high traffic areas, movable seating, and other hazards. Choose a place for your painting that will not be subject to environmental extremes. Bathrooms with tubs or showers will experience rapid fluctuations in humidity. Paintings hung above air conditioning or heating vents will be exposed to rapid changes in temperature. A painting above a mantel will be exposed to soot and extreme heat. Lighting can create localized areas of extreme heat and must be considered carefully. Lights that attach to the top of the frame and hang over the picture can heat the painting unevenly or even fall onto the artwork, causing burns or tears. Indirect sunlight or ceiling mounted lights are best for home installations.<sup><a href="Bibliography.html#Work1">[1]</a></sup> However, direct sunlight is not recommended.<sup><a href="Bibliography.html#Work2">[2]</a></sup></p>
            
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you must store any work of art, avoid traditional storage locations such as basements, garages, and attics. These places are not climate controlled; the environment will damage your art. A better storage location is a closet in your home.<sup><a href="Bibliography.html#Work1">[1]</a></sup> When choosing a location for storage, look for areas that are free as possible from rodents and insects.<sup><a href="Bibliography.html#Work3">[3]</a></sup></p>
            
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way a painting is stored is crucial to its wellbeing. Never store paintings flat. The best way to store paintings is between padded, divided racks. Keep paintings in their frames. Never seal paintings or any other object in plastic for plastic seals create “mini-environments” of high humidity. Humidity encourages the growth of mold spores and degradation. In order to keep dust off a painting in storage, a piece of cloth or heavy brown paper can be secured to the back of the painting and draped across the front.<sup><a href="Bibliography.html#Work3">[3]</a></sup></p>
            
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you must move your painting from a wall or move it to another room, clear the pathway of furniture and prepare a location to receive the painting. Always carry a painting with the image facing you. If the picture is wider than your shoulders, ask someone to help you carry the painting. Moving large or unframed paintings may require the services of professionals.<sup><a href="Bibliography.html#Work1">[1]</a></sup></p>
            
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another way to keep your painting in good condition is to dust the image every four to six months. Do not use feather dusters, as they may scratch or snag paintings. Make-up brushes, badger-hair brushes, or soft watercolor brushes will work best for dusting.<sup><a href="Bibliography.html#Work1">[1]</a> <a href="Bibliography.html#Work2">[2]</a></sup> Avoid touching your painting because the oils in your skin may leave marks that will appear later. Remove paintings from a room before steam-cleaning carpets or wallpaper and return the artwork only after the walls and floors are completely dry. The rapid change in humidity might damage the painting.<sup><a href="Bibliography.html#Work1">[1]</a></sup> The different layers of the painting react differently to varying humidity levels. Low humidity levels can cause the fabric support to tighten, causing cracks in the painting, while high relative humidity can cause the paint to flake and encourages mold growth.<sup><a href="Bibliography.html#Work2">[2]</a></sup></p>
            
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unattached pieces of paint from the painting, or flakes, should be saved, as a conservator can re-attach these pieces to maintain more of the original work. Paintings that are damaged to the point of flaking should not be displayed vertically, but should be laid flat until a conservator can be consulted. Tears in the canvas itself can be temporarily mended by applying surgical tape to the reverse side, but this method should only be used until professional help is sought.<sup><a href="Bibliography.html#Work2">[2]</a></sup></p>
            
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you notice damage to your painting, consult a conservator. However, treatment is not always necessary. For example, oil paint becomes more transparent with age, and most paintings develop small, inconsequential cracks. Some evidence of aging is natural and should be accepted. When structural damages or damage such as tears, flaking paint, or mold occur, a conservator should be consulted to decide on treatment options.<sup><a href="Bibliography.html#Work1">[1]</a></sup></p>
